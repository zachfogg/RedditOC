## About

A Chromium extension that will highlight the original commenter's subsequent posts within his comment thread. This is useful to increase readability, and to decrease scrolling.

It is written in CoffeeScript, so you want to view the CoffeeScript file, and not the generated JavaScript file.


### TO-DO

1. When users click 'load more comments', inspect the loaded comments and colorize as necessary.
2. Allow users to customize the CSS of original commenters.
3. Share with the world.
