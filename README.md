## About

A Chromium extension that will highlight the original commenter's subsequent posts within his comment thread. This is useful to increase readability, and to decrease scrolling.

It is written in CoffeeScript, so you want to view the CoffeeScript file, and not the generated JavaScript file.


### TO-DO

1. Allow users to customize the CSS of original commenters.
2. Optimize the rootWithinTree function, which often has duplicate elements in its return value.
3. Share with the world.
